      "Introduction  \n",
      "Aviva plc is a leading multinational insurance, savings, investments, retirement and health provider, headquartered in London, United Kingdom. Serving more than 20.5 million customers across its core markets in the UK, Ireland and Canada, Aviva offers an extensive range of personal and business products that protect people, their families, their assets and their futures. With over 325 years of heritage, Aviva has built a reputation for financial strength, innovation, customer service and long-term value creation. In 2024 alone, Aviva paid out £29.3 billion in benefits and claims, demonstrating its commitment to keeping the promises made to its customers.  \n",

      "Aviva’s origins date back to the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encompassing a series of mutual societies and proprietary businesses that merged and evolved over time. Landmark institutions in its lineage include Norwich Union (founded 1797), Commercial Union (1861) and General Accident (1885). In 2000, Commercial Union and Norwich Union merged to form CGU plc; two years later CGU combined with General Accident to form CGNU. In 2002 the business was rebranded as Aviva, a name derived from the Latin word “viva,” meaning to be alive. This name change symbolized Aviva’s commitment to vitality, resilience and innovation. Throughout its history, Aviva has demonstrated an ability to adapt to changing market conditions, regulatory environments and customer needs.  \n",
